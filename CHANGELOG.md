and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository bootstrap: license (MIT), contribution guide, code of conduct,
  security policy, issue/PR templates, placeholder CI.
- Deep-dive research notes for Claude Code, Codex, ZCode, and the tooling
  landscape (`docs/research/`).
- Product proposal (`docs/PROPOSAL.md`) and technical specification
  (`docs/SPEC.md`) — published for review.
- CONTRIBUTING guidance: only final artifacts belong in the repo (no
  conversation logs or exploration transcripts).
- Machine health subsystem (spec §5): system + per-session resource
  monitoring, overload alerts, launch admission advisor, crash recovery,
  and optimization recommendations.
- Fleet / multi-machine architecture (spec §11): mDNS discovery, code
  pairing, gRPC over mutual TLS, telemetry/control sync with
  credentials-never-leave-the-machine invariant; fleet milestones M6/M7
  toward 1.0.
- Release & platform policy: macOS-first signed + notarized builds
  (Apple Developer via Vuxtra), strict semver with 0.x beta channel,
  stable channel at 1.0.
- Execution plan (docs/plan/EPICS.md): epics → tasks → acceptance
  criteria for M0 through 1.0, per-milestone validation gates with
  committed gate reports and user confirmation.
- Quality standards (docs/plan/QUALITY.md): engineering standards and
  the per-task Definition of Done applied to every requirement.
- Architecture decision records (docs/adr/): Tauri 2, adapter
  architecture, automation policy, fleet transport, MIT license.
- Autonomous build runbook (docs/plan/RUNBOOK.md): the operating
  contract for unattended build runs — PR flow, DoD, gate stops, hard
  rails.

### Added (M0-1)

- Cargo workspace with the seven `juggler-*` crates; workspace lint
  baseline (clippy pedantic subset, `unwrap/expect/panic/todo` warnings,
  `missing_docs` deny, `unsafe_code` forbid); pinned toolchain
  (1.99.0, MSRV 1.99); cargo-deny policy; `just` task runner
  (`just verify` = the CI gate, locally).

### Added (M0-2)

- CI pipeline: `verify` job (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, docs with
  `-D warnings`, cargo-deny, llvm-cov coverage artifact) plus a
  cross-platform build matrix (macOS arm64 + x86_64 cross-check, Linux,
  Windows); required status checks enforced on `main`.

### Added (M0-3)

- Domain model in `juggler-core`: typed identifiers, `Account`, `Profile`,
  `SessionRecord`, session statuses (incl. `QuotaBlocked`), usage snapshots
  with confidence levels, quota windows, transcript refs; typed
  `CoreError`.
- SQLite storage: WAL + foreign keys, forward-only versioned migrations
  (newer-schema databases rejected, corrupt files degrade to
  `NotADatabase`), repositories for accounts/profiles/sessions with
  cascade deletes.
- Crash-safe `atomic_write` helper.
- Property-based round-trip tests (proptest) for every entity plus
  migration, corruption, cascade, and atomic-write edge cases.

### Added (M0-4)

- `juggler-adapter`: the `HarnessAdapter` contract — capability flags,
  discovery reports with `verified_against` version pinning, launch
  specs (interactive/headless, account-aware), the read-only
  `SessionWatcher` event interface, and an id-keyed adapter registry.
- `juggler-adapters`: the scriptable `fake-harness` binary (JSONL
  transcripts, turns/stall/burn/exit fixtures, resume) and the
  `FakeHarnessAdapter` reference implementation with a polling watcher.
- End-to-end adapter test: discover → prepare account → launch spec →
  run → watch (discovered/appended/ended) → resume.

### Added (Gate V0)

- Gate V0 validation report (docs/qa/gate-M0.md): CI matrix, coverage
  baseline meeting QUALITY.md targets, functional acceptance evidence,
  quality audit with fixes applied in-PR, and carried-forward items.
- Coverage-closing tests: repository update/delete paths, launch-spec
  constructors, registry trait-object usage, adapter degrade paths.

### Added (M0-5)

- `juggler-supervisor`: PTY (interactive) and piped (headless) spawning
  with per-profile env overlays; lifecycle event bus
  (Started/Exited with signal detail); bounded output ring buffer
  (512 KiB/session); SIGTERM→SIGKILL stop ladder; process-tree
  descendant tracking via sysinfo ppid walks; append-only supervision
  journal with crash re-adoption (`adopt_orphans`, zombies treated as
  dead); children survive supervisor/app death by design.
- Integration tests: spawn/capture/stop, external SIGKILL → journaled
  exit, drop-survival + journal re-adoption, process-tree tracking,
  PTY output capture, unknown-session errors.

### Added (M1-1)

- Tauri 2 application shell (`juggler-app`): strict CSP (self only),
  minimal core capability, generated brand icon placeholder, `app_info`
  command + `app://ready` event, typed both sides via ts-rs (Rust is
  the single source for TS types).
- Webview UI scaffold (`ui/`): React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind
  v4; dark-first design tokens; base primitives (Button/Card/Chip/
  StatCard/QuotaRing); inline SVG icons; app shell (rail nav, status
  bar, dashboard placeholder); typed bridge with browser fallback.
- CI: `ui` job (typecheck + build) as a required check; Tauri Linux
  system dependencies for cargo jobs.

### Added (M1-2)

- Claude Code adapter: PATH + installer-default + override binary
  discovery with `--version` verification against pinned releases
  (drift warns, never fails); isolated `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` account
  preparation (0700 dirs, 0600 managed-marker, idempotent); metadata-only
  login detection (credentials-file presence + macOS namespaced keychain
  probe — never reads token contents); guided vendor-login launch spec;
  interactive/headless launch specs with settings-overlay env merging.

### Changed

- Handover model upgraded from summary packs to tiered session sync:
  native resume (T1), cross-account session transplant (T2), cross-harness
  transcript replay (T3); context packs remain as preview/export format (T4).
- Explicit automation policy in spec and proposal: monitoring, alerts,
  suggestions, and staging are automated; every state-changing action is
  executed by an explicit user click.

### Added (M1-5)

- Claude Code transcript parser: version-tolerant JSONL extraction
  (uuid/parentUuid/sessionId, roles, text content, token usage) with
  per-kind counters, malformed-line skip-and-count (never panics), and
  resume dedupe by message uuid (first occurrence wins).
- Committed anonymized fixture corpus: basic conversation with
  tool_use/tool_result, subagent sidechains, resumed-session duplicates,
  and malformed damage cases.
- notify-based transcript watcher: fs events wake the watcher; a bounded
  recursive walk is the self-healing diff source (lost/coalesced fs
  events recover on the next poll); emits Discovered/MessageAppended.
- Fuzz scaffold (`fuzz/`): `transcript_parse` target exercising parser +
  dedupe on arbitrary bytes (cargo-fuzz, nightly; outside the workspace).

### Added (M1-3)

- App backend: `AppState` (SQLite storage, adapter registry, journaling
  supervisor) with per-platform data-dir resolution; 13 typed Tauri
  commands (accounts, profiles, sessions, launch/stop, login state and
  copyable vendor-login command, dashboard stats); lifecycle forwarder
  persisting session status transitions; `Profile.name` (schema v2
  migration).
- Supervisor fix surfaced by integration testing: the PTY path now
  inherits the base environment and applies the profile overlay on top
  (spec §4 env semantics).
- Launcher UI (Profiles screen): account cards with harness glyph, plan
  and login chips; per-profile rows with model chips and one-click
  Launch; add-account and new-profile modals; guided-login modal with
  copyable isolated login command (external-terminal fallback) and
  re-check; empty states; dashboard shows live counts. Typed bridge with
  plain-browser design-preview mocks.
- Integration tests (unix): two accounts launch in parallel through the
  full app stack with complete config-dir isolation and per-account
  settings overlays; write containment verified across the sandbox
  (zero writes outside the app data dir).

### Added (M1-3b)

- Smart onboarding foundation (ADR-0006, spec §12.1): adapter-level
  `scan_environment` finds existing setups — the vendor default
  (`~/.claude`), `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` overrides (other manager tools),
  and `.claude*` home-pattern dirs (manual or AI-created) — with
  metadata-only login probes, dedup, and most-useful-first ordering.
- Config import: `import_account` byte-copies a discovered setup into a
  fresh managed dir (0700 + marker), skipping rebuildable caches, with a
  2 GiB fail-fast ceiling and a read-only guarantee toward the source
  (tree-snapshot tested). Keychain-locked logins honestly report the
  one-time re-login path; file-based logins carry over.
- Login aids capped at "we open things": per-adapter `login_url`, opened
  in the system browser via tauri-plugin-opener.
- App commands `environment_scan`, `account_import` (creates a default
  `Main` profile so imports are immediately launchable), and
  `login_open_web`; typed bridge entries with browser-preview mocks.
- Integration tests: scan classification/dedup/sorting, import
  correctness + source immutability + ceiling, and the command-level
  onboarding path (import → launch → session recorded).

### Added (M1-4)

- Embedded terminal (xterm.js + PTY streaming, issue #20): tabbed
  terminal dock at the bottom of the window — drag-resizable, collapsible
  with ⌘J, layout persisted. Live sessions and guided logins stream into
  it; closing a tab's panel and reopening replays the retained tail.
- Supervisor: PTY keyboard input (`write_input`), resize (`resize_pty`),
  live output taps (ring listeners, one forwarder per terminal), and
  exit probes (`is_finished`).
- App surface: `terminal_spawn_login` (vendor login in an isolated PTY),
  `terminal_attach` (idempotent streaming), `terminal_write/resize/kill/
  snapshot`; base64 chunk events batched at a 16 ms flush — the 60 fps
  UI budget. Guided login now runs fully in-app; the login modal also
  opens the vendor's sign-in page (claude.ai) or copies the command.
- Launch flows land in the dock: clicking Launch opens a terminal tab
  attached to the interactive session.
- Tests: PTY input/resize/tap round-trip; 20 concurrent streaming
  sessions fan-out without deadlock (M1-4 perf floor); app-level
  terminal cores (echo → snapshot replay → stop ladder); login spec
  env-scoping proof.

### Changed (design iteration 4 — instance-centric IA, ADR-0007)

- Reframed the product around what it manages — **instances of AI coding
  tools (CLI today, desktop next) working on tracked projects** — instead
  of a CLI-session board.
- Domain (schema v3): `sessions.kind` (`terminal` | `desktop`) and a
  first-class `projects` table keyed by canonical root; launches touch
  their project and link the session to it — the lineage that powers
  switch/hand-over.
- UI rebuilt to two modes: left rail = **Projects / Instances / Sessions**
  (project panel: who's on it now, account history, launch-with-another-
  account; instance panel: status, kind badge, open-terminal/stop);
  global menus top-right (Overview, Accounts, Usage, Fleet) with a
  primary Add action.
- `projects_list` command with active-instance and account-history
  rollup; ts-rs `ProjectInfo`.
- Tests: projects repo roundtrip, session kind/project-link persistence,
  and the juggling integration proof — two accounts, one shared
  directory, one tracked project with both accounts in its history and
  the live instance surfaced.

### Changed (design iteration 5 — workflow navigator)

- The left rail is now the workflow itself (ADR-0007): three tabs —
  Projects / Instances / Sessions — whose live list lives inside the
  rail (collapsing to icons with ⌘B), plus a New session action
  (⌘N) anchored in the navigator.
- Selecting anything loads its panel on the right; selecting a session
  or instance embeds its **terminal directly in the panel** — the
  bottom dock is gone. Panels cross-link: session → its project,
  project → its sessions, project → launch-with-another-account (the
  one-click juggle), all drill-in-place.
- New-session modal: profile picker + optional directory (launching
  into a directory creates/reuses its project), lands selected with
  its terminal open.
- Guided logins join the Sessions rail list under "Sign-ins" and open
  in the same panel; ended items keep replayable scrollback.

### Changed (design iteration 6 — rail polish: responsive by construction)

- Tabs reflow instead of clipping: labels truncate cleanly down to a
  threshold, then fade to icon-only with tooltips (rail widths
  208–360px); collapsed shows stacked icon tabs. Nothing overflows at
  any width.
- Drag-resize restored on the rail (hairline handle that lights up on
  hover/drag, persisted width; double-click collapses), with the
  layout audit-driven at default/narrow/collapsed states.
- Tighter design-system pass on the rail: 7px row rhythm, 12.5/10.5px
  type pair, Linear-style 2px accent selection bars, focus-visible
  rings, proper aria tablist semantics, tooltips only when labels are
  hidden.
- Thin overlay-style scrollbars across rail and panels.

### Added (M1-3b Phase C — onboarding wizard)

- The zero-knowledge add-account flow (ADR-0006, spec §12.1): Detect
  (auto environment scan, findings in plain language with origin and
  sign-in state) → Identity (plain-words purpose + plan tier, or
  one-tap import of a discovered setup) → Login (sign in inside AI
  Juggler / open claude.ai / copyable command / re-check, with the
  honest keychain note when import can't carry the login) → Summary
  (what was created, what was skipped, original untouched).
- First run with zero accounts opens the wizard automatically (once
  per explicit dismissal); Accounts → Add account uses the same flow.
- Replaces the old add-account form modal; fully reviewable in a
  plain browser via mocks.

### Added (scanner: other manager tools, verified against t3.codes)

- Environment scan now covers **other manager tools' profile roots**
  (new `manager-tool` origin): t3.codes' `ClaudeCodeProfiles/` verified
  on a real machine with five live profiles. Manager-tool findings say
  plainly that the tool and its sessions are never touched.
- Login honesty for pre-2.1.56 setups: when only the legacy shared
  keychain entry exists, manager-tool imports note that a one-time
  re-login inside AI Juggler is likely.
- Operational runner (ignored test) importing real profiles into the
  app's data dir; used to import the user's five t3.codes profiles
  read-only (originals manifest-verified untouched; live session
  transcripts kept growing in the source, proving t3 undisturbed).
