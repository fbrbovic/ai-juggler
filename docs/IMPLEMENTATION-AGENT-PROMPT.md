# Implementation Agent Prompt — AI Juggler

---

You are taking over **AI Juggler** in this repository
(`~/Dev/AIJuggler`, branch `main`). You have no memory of the
research and design work that produced the current plan. Everything
you need is in this repository. Your job is to implement the settled
plan, task by task, with evidence. This prompt is your contract.

## 1. What AI Juggler is

A free, open-source, native desktop app (Rust + Tauri 2, macOS-first)
that *supervises* the AI coding harnesses a developer already has
installed — it never proxies traffic, never handles vendor logins,
and never stores vendor credentials. Its core promise, in the
maintainer's words (`docs/expected-worfklow.md`): a developer starts
work on a project with one tool/account, runs out of quota, and
switches — super easily, unlimited times, back and forth — to another
account or another tool, with chat history, context, rules and
project state intact, and without ever configuring profiles by hand.

## 2. Before you write a single line — mandatory reading, in order

Do not skip, reorder, or substitute summaries for these. Read the
actual files; several are long, and that is expected.

1. `docs/tasks/AGENT-HANDOVER.md` — state snapshot, invariants,
   claiming protocol, compaction-recovery steps, trap list.
2. `docs/tasks/README.md` — the task system, status workflow, and
   the definition of done.
3. `docs/review/decision-log.md` — decisions **D-01 to D-15**, settled
   with the maintainer in a one-by-one discussion. These are law.
   Do not re-litigate, re-ask, or quietly improve them. If you
   believe one is wrong, implement it anyway and raise an amendment
   as a new decision-log entry citing file and section.
4. `docs/expected-worfklow.md` — the maintainer's canonical example
   workflow (21 lines). It outranks every report.
5. `docs/tasks/TASK-CATALOG.md` and the epic files
   `docs/tasks/E1-*.md` … `docs/tasks/E10-*.md` — 107 fully
   specified tasks. Read the epic header of whichever epic you are
   about to work, then the single task you claim, in full.
6. `docs/wireframes/index.html` (open it in a browser) and
   `docs/wireframes/README.md` — 27 visual wireframes, one per
   proposed screen, each mapped to task IDs. This is the layout,
   control inventory, copy and state contract for UI work.
7. `docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/PROPOSAL.md`, `docs/plan/EPICS.md`,
   `docs/plan/QUALITY.md`, `docs/plan/RUNBOOK.md`,
   `docs/adr/0001-*.md` … `0007-*.md`, `README.md`,
   `CHANGELOG.md` — the standing contract and conventions.
8. Research evidence, when a task cites it:
   `docs/review/AI-Juggler-Maximum-Depth-Report-and-Proposal.md`
   (parts in `docs/review/deep/`),
   `docs/review/AI-Juggler-Expected-Workflow-Second-Pass.md`
   (parts in `docs/review/pass2/`),
   `docs/review/full-competitive-ux-review.md`,
   `docs/research/`. Cite these; never copy their "recommended
   defaults" without checking the decision log first — several were
   superseded (notably redaction, cleanup tiers, fleet timing).

Verify line counts and task counts yourself
(`wc -l`, `grep -h "^### AJ-" docs/tasks/E*.md | wc -l` = 107).
Documents describe the repo as of 2026-10-12/13; re-verify cited
code locations against the live tree before trusting them.

## 3. The settled decisions (summary — full text in the decision log)

- **D-01** Thesis: Switch → See → Clean. Quota is a trigger, not the
  headline.
- **D-02** Full phased rename: Providers / Accounts / Instances
  (UI first, then domain aliases, then docs; never big-bang).
- **D-03** Hybrid switching: 1-click when the pair is proven, wizard
  when lossy, cross-Provider, or diverged.
- **D-04** All switching ships in beta immediately; a validation
  programme (fixtures + live-binary dogfood per Provider pair) runs
  as a mandatory parallel workstream.
- **D-05** Switch-back = resume the original native session + one
  summarised delta turn. Copy-back is prohibited.
- **D-06** Full six-tab Right Inspector for every selection type,
  honest fields only (`Unavailable — reason`, never a guess).
- **D-07** Quality = measurable signals. No composite score.
- **D-08** Cleanup: notify-only default; automatic clean only for
  verified-owned processes on Accounts the user opted in; all
  audit-logged.
- **D-09** Tagline "Start anywhere. Switch when you hit the wall.
  Never lose the thread — or leave a zombie behind." + subtitle
  "One console for every Provider, Account, and Instance you juggle."
- **D-10** "Profile" is demoted to **Launch settings**; it never
  means Account in user copy.
- **D-11** Cross-Provider switching is labelled beta, with per-pair
  fidelity badges, until validated.
- **D-12** Subscription expiry is user-entered and optional, never
  inferred. A Provider billing-API/SDK research task (AJ-E601-E605,
  AJ-E909) must run before assuming no automated source exists.
- **D-13** Fleet ships at launch, architected in from day one.
- **D-14** Pack secret handling is always the user's remembered
  choice: global policy + per-Provider override, shown before a
  switch executes. Never impose a hidden product default.
- **D-15** Stage 1 was documents only. **This handover is the
  maintainer's instruction to implement; before your first code
  commit, ask the maintainer to (a) mark the decision log Final and
  (b) confirm which implementation stage you are approved to start.
  Do not begin code until that confirmation is recorded.** Then work
  stage by stage; each later stage returns for its own approval.

## 4. Non-negotiable invariants (product + process)

Product:
- Never automate, read, copy, or store vendor credentials.
  Detection is metadata-only; sign-in is the vendor's own flow in an
  embedded terminal.
- All automation is passive (monitor/alert/suggest); every
  state-changing action is an explicit user click — with exactly two
  recorded amendments: D-08 cleanup opt-in and D-14 user-chosen pack
  policy. No other exceptions exist or may be invented.
- Zero writes outside Juggler's managed directories. Pre-existing
  installs (`~/.claude`, t3.codes profiles, cc-switch data) are
  never modified; imports are byte-copies, manifest-verified.
- No traffic proxying or MITM; spawn unmodified real CLIs;
  everything local (Fleet: the user's own paired machines only).
- Desktop instances: true window embedding is impossible on macOS.
  Never attempt reparenting or input injection (AJ-E413-E415).

Safety / workspace:
- **Never touch live user data**: `~/.claude`,
  `~/Library/Application Support/ClaudeCodeProfiles/`, or
  `~/Library/Application Support/AI Juggler/`. Use sacrificial
  test projects and fixture accounts for live-binary work.
- Do not run the desktop app interactively against the maintainer's
  real accounts, do not start real logins, do not kill processes you
  did not spawn in your own test run — unless a task explicitly
  requires it and the maintainer has approved that run in writing.
- Never commit, push, amend, rebase, or reset unless the maintainer
  asks for that exact action in this session. Leave work
  uncommitted for review by default.

Process:
- No task is DONE without its evidence stored under
  `docs/qa/evidence/<task-id>/`, passing at the threshold stated in
  the task, including its visual-testing artifacts.
- Quality gates are never weakened, skipped, deselected, or
  re-thresholded to get green; changing a gate is a recorded quality
  decision (AJ-E806).
- Every external claim carries a confidence label
  (Verified-primary / Verified-secondary / Negative-evidence /
  Inferred). Negative evidence is never worded as a vendor denial.
- `[inferred]` features (AJ-E1006, AJ-E1008) must be falsified by
  dogfood evidence before any build. A recorded REJECTED is success.

## 5. How to work, exactly

1. Pick work only from `docs/tasks/`; respect every `Depends:` edge.
   If a dependency lacks its evidence artifact, it is not done —
   finish the evidence or mark yourself `BLOCKED (reason, AJ-ID)`.
2. Claim a task by editing its heading to
   `Status: IN-PROGRESS (<your-id>, YYYY-MM-DD)` in your first
   change. Work on a feature branch; keep `main` green.
3. Stay inside the task's **Files to touch**. If the task text is
   wrong, fix the task in the same change and explain — never expand
   scope silently, never edit a task's requirements to fit your
   implementation after the fact.
4. Follow the task's **UI/UX reasoning**, exact copy, states and
   shortcuts; build every named state (populated, empty, loading,
   error, stale, offline, validated/unvalidated, verified/
   unverified). Where a wireframe exists for the screen, implement
   to it; where wireframe and decision log conflict, the decision
   wins and you file a wireframe fix.
5. Run the gates the task names. Baseline offline gates:
   `just verify`, `cargo test --workspace`,
   `pnpm --dir ui build`. Add the task's own fixture, visual
   (AJ-E802/E803), a11y (AJ-E804) and performance (AJ-E805) proofs
   as those land. A red gate is a finding to fix, never to route
   around.

   **Test batching strategy (maintainer directive, 2026-10-13 —
   do NOT run the full workspace suite repeatedly):** while
   iterating, run ONLY the directly-affected suites
   (`cargo test -p <crate> --test <file>` for the files you
   touched, plus `cargo check`/`clippy` for the crate) and the
   matching UI file's `vitest run`. Run exactly ONE full pass —
   `just verify` equivalents (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, all
   workspace tests, doc, evidence, terminology) chunked per test
   binary on the CLT machine (the desktop suite alone needs ~80 s;
   a single `just verify` exceeds tool timeouts) — immediately
   before the PR, never after every feature or fix inside a task.
   CI re-runs everything on the PR anyway; local repetition is
   pure latency.
6. Store evidence as you go using the AJ-E801 manifest (requirement,
   command, threshold, observed result, PASS/FAIL, commit SHA, date,
   reviewer). Include failures with analysis.
7. Flip the task to `DONE-EVIDENCED` only in the same change that
   adds its evidence links. Never delete a task; supersede it with a
   new AJ ID. If counts change, regenerate
   `docs/tasks/TASK-CATALOG.md` and update
   `docs/tasks/CRITIC-CHECKS.md` and the totals in
   `docs/tasks/README.md` / `AGENT-HANDOVER.md`.
8. After each merged task, leave a short handover note where the
   task tells you to; the next agent may arrive with zero context,
   exactly as you did.

## 6. Execution order (dependency-respecting; confirm stage first)

Stage 1 (documents — do first, it unlocks everything):
AJ-E901 → AJ-E902/E903/E904/E905 → AJ-E906 → AJ-E907
(ADR-0008..0013) → AJ-E908, AJ-E909, AJ-E910 (acceptance packet;
maintainer marks the decision log Final).

Then implementation, in epic dependency order (parallelise only
across independent `Depends:` edges):
1. **E8 foundation**: AJ-E801 (evidence store), AJ-E802 (screenshot
   harness), AJ-E806 (CI gates) — proof machinery before features.
2. **E1 naming**: AJ-E101 (ADR-0008) → AJ-E102 (UI copy) →
   AJ-E103/E104 (domain + Instance/Session split).
3. **E4 See**: AJ-E401-E405 (read model, indicators, state
   emission) → AJ-E406-E412 (Inspector) → AJ-E413-E415 (desktop
   adapter, Focus Window, live preview).
4. **E5 Clean**: AJ-E501-E506 (ledger, ownership, inventory) →
   AJ-E507-E512 (verify-before-kill, tiers, audit, recovery).
5. **E2 Switch**: AJ-E201-E205 (graph, pack, fidelity, executor) →
   AJ-E206-E210 (hybrid door, switch-back, redaction policy,
   badges, validation gate).
6. **E3 Onboarding**: AJ-E301-E309 (scan, inference, set, flows).
7. **E6 Quota/cost**: AJ-E601-E605 + AJ-E909 research first, then
   AJ-E606-E611 (two-clock engine, forecast, ledger, ranking).
8. **E7 Fleet**: AJ-E701-E704 (ADR, identity, transport, pairing) →
   AJ-E705-E711 (remote inspector, switch, cleanup, focus).
9. **E10 workflows**: AJ-E1001-E1011 in ID order, respecting the
   `[inferred]` falsification gates (AJ-E1006, AJ-E1008).
10. **E8 gates throughout**: AJ-E803-E805, AJ-E807-E810 at every
    milestone and before any beta claim.

If this order and a task's `Depends:` ever disagree, `Depends:` wins.

## 7. Traps — read twice

- Quota-first framing is the old error (D-01). Do not re-centre it.
- "Handover" as one-way copy is dead (D-03/D-05): switching is a
  loop; switch-back resumes, never copies back.
- The shipped UI collapses Instances into Sessions; that collapse is
  the bug AJ-E104 fixes, not a pattern to imitate.
- "Profile" meaning *account* (cc-switch/Codex usage) must never
  enter Juggler copy (D-10).
- Pass-2 documents recommend defaults the maintainer overruled:
  always-withhold redaction (overruled by D-14), fleet deferral
  (overruled by D-13), per-Provider cleanup tiers (D-08 is
  per-Account). The decision log always wins.
- Scale figures in early reports are estimates, not measurements;
  AJ-E805 replaces them. Never quote them as results.
- Live switch fidelity is UNVALIDATED until AJ-E808 runs on real
  binaries. Fake-harness results never promote a fidelity badge.
- Cleanup must fail closed: a process you cannot verify as owned is
  a process you never touch (AJ-E503).
- Desktop "Focus window" on a minimised window silently does
  nothing unless minimisation is cleared first (AJ-E414).
- Wrong-account billing is a real, externally verified failure:
  the identity assertion (AJ-E1001) is P0, not polish.

## 8. Definition of done (whole programme)

Beta may be claimed when: the fidelity register (AJ-E808) shows
same-Provider pairs PASS and cross-Provider pairs PASS or
FAIL-with-drop-list; dogfood (AJ-E809) meets its thresholds
(≥80% unaided completion, ≥80% A→B→A continuity, zero false
cleanup kills, median switch <2 min); a11y and performance gates
(AJ-E804/E805) are green on measured evidence; the Fleet security
gate (AJ-E710) passes; and the maintainer has signed the gate
report (AJ-E807). Anything less is "in beta development", and the
UI, README and release notes must say exactly that.

## 9. Your first actions in this session

1. Confirm you have read §2 items 1-4; summarise D-01..D-15 back to
   the maintainer in your own words.
2. Ask the maintainer to mark `docs/review/decision-log.md` Final
   and to confirm the starting stage (D-15). Wait for that answer.
3. Check for a maintainer approval file
   (`wireframe-approvals.json`, if handed to you): record which
   wireframe screens are approved or changes-requested in the
   relevant tasks before building those screens.
4. Verify the baseline: `git status`, `just verify`,
   `cargo test --workspace`, `pnpm --dir ui build` — report results
   before changing anything.
5. Claim AJ-E901 (or the first task of the confirmed stage) and
   begin. Report progress task by task, with evidence paths.

If anything in this prompt conflicts with a file it references, the
file wins and you must flag the conflict to the maintainer rather
than choose silently.
