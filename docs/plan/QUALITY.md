# AI Juggler — Engineering quality standards

This is an enterprise-grade, open-source product. The code *is* the product: thousands of developers will read it, and everything here exists so that reading it is a pleasure and auditing it is easy. **These standards apply to every task in [EPICS.md](./EPICS.md) without exception — "Definition of Done" below is part of every single requirement.**

## 1. Principles

1. **Correctness first, then clarity, then performance** — in that order. Performance work is driven by benches, never guesses.
2. **No shortcuts, no quick hacks.** A hack that saves an hour costs every future reader. If a proper fix is out of scope for a task, the shortcut is documented as an issue *and* an ADR-level note, and has an owner and a milestone.
3. **The repo always tells the truth.** `main` is green and releasable; docs match behavior; CHANGELOG matches releases; no dead code pretending to be alive.
4. **Degrade, never crash.** We parse external, version-drifting formats for a living — malformed input is expected input.
5. **Boring, idiomatic Rust.** We follow the same patterns the ecosystem uses; novelty requires an ADR.

## 2. Definition of Done — every task, every time

A task is done only when **all** of the following are true:

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from EPICS.md (mirrored in the issue) demonstrably pass.
- [ ] `just verify` clean: `cargo fmt --check`, `clippy -D warnings` (workspace lints), `cargo test`, `cargo doc` — zero warnings.
- [ ] Public items documented (`#![deny(missing_docs)]` on all crates); doc comments explain *why*, not *what*.
- [ ] Errors: typed (`thiserror`) in libraries; `anyhow` only at the binary/FFI edge; **no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths** (tests and truly-infallible cases with a comment excepted).
- [ ] Logging via `tracing` (structured, level-appropriate); no `println!`/`eprintln!` in library code.
- [ ] Tests: unit tests for new logic; integration/fixture tests for new flows; parser changes extend the fixture corpus.
- [ ] Architecture conformance: dependency direction rules (§4) respected; no layer violations "just this once".
- [ ] Security: no new `unsafe`; `cargo-deny` clean; no secrets/log redaction regressions (guardrail tests still green).
- [ ] Docs updated: CHANGELOG (Unreleased), relevant spec section marked implemented, ADR if a decision was made.
- [ ] PR: small and reviewable (guideline ≤ ~400 lines of diff), linked issue, checklist completed, self-reviewed diff before requesting review.

## 3. Rust standards

- **Formatting/linting:** repo `rustfmt.toml` (hard-wrapped config, no debate in PRs); workspace `[workspace.lints]` enables a pedantic subset (`clippy::pedantic` base with explicit allowances reviewed by ADR, plus `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, `todo`, `unimplemented` denied in library crates).
- **Crate hygiene:** every crate has a crate-level doc comment with its role and a `README.md` when it has non-obvious usage. Modules stay cohesive — a module doing two jobs is two modules.
- **Naming:** type names and APIs say what they mean (`SessionRecord`, not `SessRec`); no abbreviations except established domain terms (PTY, MCP, IR).
- **Errors:** every fallible boundary has a typed error with context (`TranscriptParseError::MalformedLine { line, source }`); error types are part of the public API and semver-protected.
- **Dependencies:** minimal, audited, and justified — new top-level dependencies require a PR note with the alternative analysis. `cargo-deny` bans duplicate major versions and GPL-only entries (MIT/Apache/BSD/ISC/Unicode preferred).
- **Concurrency:** tokio runtime in the app; no async in `juggler-core` (sync, pure, testable); adapters bridge via explicit boundaries.
- **MSRV:** pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` + documented; raised only in minor releases with a CHANGELOG entry.

## 4. Architecture rules (CI-enforced)

Allowed dependency direction — violations fail CI:

```
ui (webview) → juggler-app → { juggler-core, juggler-adapter, juggler-adapters,
                               juggler-supervisor, juggler-handover, juggler-link }
juggler-adapters → juggler-adapter, juggler-core        (never the reverse)
juggler-supervisor / juggler-handover / juggler-link → juggler-core, juggler-adapter
juggler-core → (external crates only; knows nothing about app/UI)
```

- `juggler-core` contains zero I/O beyond its storage layer; it is pure domain logic and stays fully unit-testable.
- Adapters are the **only** code that knows harness specifics (spec §2 layering rule) — any harness path leaking into core/supervisor is a defect.
- UI is a view: it holds no business logic; all state originates in Rust and arrives as pre-aggregated, typed events.

## 5. Testing standards

| Layer | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Unit (`juggler-core`, math, windows, credit formula) | Property-based tests (`proptest`) where domains are numeric; plain unit tests elsewhere |
| Parsers (transcripts, configs) | **Fixture corpus** committed under each adapter's `tests/fixtures/` (anonymized, per known version shape); golden-file assertions; malformed-input tests mandatory |
| Fuzzing | `cargo-fuzz` targets for every external-format parser; corpus committed; scheduled CI fuzz job; crashes are release blockers |
| Integration | Fake-harness-driven lifecycle tests (launch → watch → stuck → crash → recover) in CI on all three OSes |
| Benchmarks | `criterion` benches for transcript parsing, usage rollups, board event fan-out; regression beyond 10% vs recorded baseline fails CI |
| Coverage | `llvm-cov`: ≥ 85% line coverage on `juggler-core`, `juggler-adapter`, `juggler-adapters`, `juggler-handover`; ≥ 80% on `juggler-supervisor`, `juggler-link`; reported at every gate |
| UI | Playwright smoke per milestone (critical flows); component tests for board/wizard |
| Guardrails | The dedicated suite (writes confinement, no network outside allowlist, no account mutation without user command, automation policy) runs in CI on every PR and at every gate |

## 6. Security & supply chain

- `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` everywhere unless an ADR approves a specific exception.
- `cargo-deny` (advisories + licenses + bans) and Dependabot on every PR; advisories are patched within a week or risk-assessed in writing.
- Secrets: never in the repo, never in logs — the redaction helper is the only sanctioned way to include paths/ids in diagnostics.
- Updater signatures and OS signing/notarization are validated at every release gate (M5+), with a deliberate negative test (tampered artifact must be rejected).
- Threat-model note maintained per release in `docs/qa/`.

## 7. Repo hygiene & process

- **Commits:** Conventional Commits; imperative subject ≤ 72 chars; body explains *why*.
- **PRs:** one concern each; the template's DoD checklist must be completed; self-review is mandatory before requesting review; review is approval-blocking for everyone (including maintainers).
- **CHANGELOG:** every user-visible change lands in `[Unreleased]` in the same PR.
- **ADRs:** any non-obvious decision gets an ADR (`docs/adr/`) — short, dated, with alternatives considered. Code links its ADR where the "why" isn't obvious.
- **Docs:** README quickstart must always work on the latest release; architecture diagrams updated in the same PR as the change.
- **Only final artifacts are committed** (see CONTRIBUTING) — clean code and docs, not exploration or conversation residue.

## 8. Validation gates (milestone-level)

Defined in [EPICS.md](./EPICS.md) (automated + functional + quality audit + report + user confirmation). The gate report template:

```markdown
# Gate VX — <Milestone>
Date: YYYY-MM-DD · Commit: <sha> · Report: docs/qa/gate-MX.md

## 1. Automated
- CI matrix: <green/failures> (links to runs)
- Coverage: <table vs targets>
- cargo-deny: <clean> · Guardrails: <pass> · Fuzz since last gate: <no new crashes>
- Benchmarks: <within budgets / regressions explained>

## 2. Functional (every acceptance criterion, with evidence)
- <Task ID>: <criterion> — <evidence link/summary> — PASS

## 3. Quality audit (vs QUALITY.md)
- Findings: <list> — Fixed in <commits> / waived with reason <never for correctness>

## 4. Known issues carried forward
- <issue links, with milestone owner>

## 5. Confirmation
- Maintainer sign-off: @fbrbovic — <date>
```

## 9. Reviewer checklist (mirrored in the PR template)

Structure & naming · layering conformance · error handling · test quality (not just presence) · docs on public APIs · CHANGELOG · fixture corpus grown if parsers touched · no secrets/unsafe · bench impact for hot paths · ADR if a decision was made.
