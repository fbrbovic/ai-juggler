# Agent Handover — Read This First, Trust Nothing Else From Memory

> Written for an agent (or human) arriving with zero context: after a

## 30-minute cold start

1. Read [README.md](README.md) in this directory (5 min).
2. Read [../review/decision-log.md](../review/decision-log.md)
   D-01..D-15 (10 min). These are settled with the maintainer. Do not
   re-ask, re-litigate or "improve" them; a change requires a new
   recorded decision with maintainer approval.
3. Skim [TASK-CATALOG.md](TASK-CATALOG.md); note the epic of your task.
4. Read your task in full, then read every source it cites under
   **Research basis** (repo files at cited lines, pass2/deep sections).
5. Check current repo state yourself (`git status`, the cited code)
   before believing any "already done" claim — including claims in the
   research reports, which describe the repo as of 2026-10-12/13.

## Current state snapshot (verify, do not trust blindly)

- Research complete: `docs/review/full-competitive-ux-review.md`
  (1,095 lines), `docs/review/AI-Juggler-Maximum-Depth-Report-and-Proposal.md`
  (6,739 lines, parts in `docs/review/deep/`),
  `docs/review/AI-Juggler-Expected-Workflow-Second-Pass.md`
  (4,784 lines, parts in `docs/review/pass2/`).
- Decisions settled: D-01..D-15 in the decision log (still Draft
  until the maintainer explicitly accepts it as Final).
- Tasks specified: 107 tasks in `docs/tasks/E1..E10`, all TODO.
- Stage boundary: only Stage 1 (documents/research, E9 + E6/E909
  research records) is approved. Implementation needs separate
  approval per stage (D-15).
- Built product (as researched): Rust/Tauri engine, Claude Code
  adapter, supervisor with embedded terminals, instance-centric UI,
  smart onboarding, handover v0. Usage/quota dashboards, Fleet,
  Codex/ZCode adapters and signed releases were placeholders at
  research time — verify before repeating.

## Non-negotiable invariants (product + process)

Product (from the original brief, still in force):
- Never automate or read vendor credentials; metadata-only detection,
  vendor's own login in an embedded terminal.
- Automation is passive (monitor/alert/suggest); state-changing
  actions are explicit clicks — with exactly two recorded amendments:
  D-08 cleanup Clean-safe per-Account opt-in, and D-14 pack handling
  per the user's remembered choice. No other exceptions exist.
- Zero writes outside managed directories; pre-existing installs are
  never modified; imports are byte-copies, manifest-verified.
- No traffic proxying/MITM; spawn unmodified real CLIs; all local
  (Fleet: user's own machines only, E7 security model).

Process (this task system):
- No task is DONE without its evidence stored under
  `docs/qa/evidence/<task-id>/` and passing at its stated threshold,
  including its visual-testing artifacts.
- Quality gates are never weakened, skipped or re-thresholded
  silently; that is itself a recorded quality decision (AJ-E806).
- External claims carry confidence labels (Verified-primary /
  Verified-secondary / Negative-evidence / Inferred); negative
  evidence is never worded as a vendor denial (AJ-E810).
- `[inferred]` features (AJ-E1006, AJ-E1008) are falsified by dogfood
  evidence before any build; a recorded REJECTED is a success.

## How to claim and work a task

1. Set its status to `IN-PROGRESS (your-id, YYYY-MM-DD)` in its epic
   file, in your first commit.
2. Work only within its **Files to touch** unless the task is wrong;
   if wrong, fix the task text first (same PR, explained) rather than
   silently expanding scope.
3. Respect every `Depends:` edge; if a dependency is incomplete, mark
   yourself `BLOCKED (reason, AJ-ID)` instead of building on sand.
4. Run the gates the task names (`just verify`, `cargo test
   --workspace`, `pnpm --dir ui build`, visual/a11y suites as they
   land). A red gate is a finding, not an obstacle to route around.
5. Store evidence as you go (AJ-E801 manifest), including failures;
   a failed run with analysis beats a curated green one.
6. Flip to `DONE-EVIDENCED` only with evidence links in the same PR.

## Compaction / context-loss recovery

- Your memory of "what we decided" is not evidence. Re-read the
  decision log and this file; check `git log` and task statuses for
  what actually landed.
- If you find a task IN-PROGRESS with no recent commit, treat it as
  unclaimed: read its epic handover note, verify repo state, then
  either claim it fresh or return it to TODO with a note.
- Half-finished documents: the reports in `docs/review/` are frozen
  evidence; corrections belong in new files that cite them, never in
  silent edits (decision log and pass2 §5.2 rule).
- When in doubt about a settled point, grep the decision log first,
  the SPEC second, chat last.

## Traps that have already bitten this project

- Quota-first framing (corrected by D-01): do not re-centre quota.
- One-way "handover" thinking (D-03/D-05): switching is a loop with
  switch-back; copy-back is prohibited.
- Instances/Sessions collapse in shipped UI: Instance is the
  occurrence, Session the conversation inside it (D-02, AJ-E104).
- "Profile" meaning account (other tools' usage): here it is Launch
  settings only (D-10).
- Always-withhold pack redaction was recommended in pass2 and
  superseded by D-14 (user's remembered choice). Check the decision
  log before copying any pass2 "recommended default".
- Fleet deferral in pass2 roadmap superseded by D-13 (launch).
- Scale numbers in early reports are estimates, not measurements;
  AJ-E805 exists to replace them. Never quote them as results.
- Live handover fidelity is unproven on real binaries; AJ-E808 owns
  the truth. Stub/fake results never promote a fidelity badge.
- Credential byte-copy on import contradicts SPEC §8 wording; it is
  an open Phase-0 decision (E9), not a settled fact either way.
- Never touch live user data: `~/.claude`, other managers' profile
  roots, or the running app's state directories. Sacrificial/fixture
  projects only for live-binary validation.

## Open items that are research gates, not decisions

- Provider billing/renewal APIs: unknown until AJ-E601-E605/E909
  record per-Provider proof (D-12). Default product behaviour until
  then: user-entered, optional, never inferred.
- Codex/ZCode/Gemini switch fidelity: UNVALIDATED until AJ-E808.
- Persona claims: composites until AJ-E809 dogfood validates them.

## Who can change what

- Maintainer: decisions (decision log → Final), gate sign-offs,
  quality-gate weakenings, scope-stage approvals.
- Any agent: task execution within scope, evidence, task-text fixes
  with explanation, new follow-up tasks (new AJ IDs, never renumber).
