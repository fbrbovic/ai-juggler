## What & why

<!-- What does this PR change, and why? Link the issue it addresses ("Closes #123"). -->

## Definition of Done ([docs/plan/QUALITY.md](../docs/plan/QUALITY.md) — required for every PR)

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from the issue demonstrably pass
- [ ] `just verify` clean (fmt, clippy `-D warnings`, tests, docs) — zero warnings
- [ ] Public APIs documented; typed errors; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic!` in production paths
- [ ] Tests added (unit + integration/fixtures for new flows; corpus grown if parsers touched)
- [ ] Architecture layering respected (QUALITY.md §4); no new `unsafe`; `cargo-deny` clean
- [ ] CHANGELOG updated; spec/docs updated if behavior changed; ADR if a decision was made
