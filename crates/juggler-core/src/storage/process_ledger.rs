//! Process ledger repository (AJ-E501, pass2 §5): the queryable
//! SQLite table that survives root exit, app exit, and reboot — the
//! basis for orphan detection. The JSONL journal stays a crash log;
//! THIS is the query store (the task's trap: never extend the journal
//! into one).
//!
//! Rows are written `Intent`-first (state `Starting`, no PID) BEFORE
//! the spawn, patched immediately after (PID/PGID/OS start time),
//! helpers upserted batched per reconciler tick, exits patched with
//! their kind. Exited rows retain 7 days; running rows are never
//! pruned.
