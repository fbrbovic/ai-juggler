//! Environment scanning and config import for smart onboarding (spec §12,
//! ADR-0006).
//!
//! The onboarding wizard assumes the user knows nothing about how harness
//! config directories work: adapters scan the machine for existing
//! installations so the wizard can offer "import what you already have"
//! instead of a blank form.
//!
//! Guardrails (ADR-0003/0006): scanning is **metadata-only** — file
//! presence, sizes, and timestamps, never contents; importing is
//! **read-only toward the source** — a plain byte copy into a fresh managed
//! dir, with the source left untouched and unmarked.
