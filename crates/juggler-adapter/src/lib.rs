//! The `HarnessAdapter` contract — the only place harness specifics are allowed
//! to live (ADR-0002).
//!
//! This crate defines the [`HarnessAdapter`] trait, capability flags,
//! discovery reports, launch specs, and session-watching interfaces that every
//! harness integration (Claude Code, Codex, `ZCode`, future community
//! adapters) implements. It is semver-protected public API: external adapters
//! build against it, so breaking changes are guarded by `cargo-semver-checks`
//! in CI. Requirements: `docs/SPEC.md` §4.
